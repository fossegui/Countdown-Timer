## Code Structure

The provided HTML and JavaScript code creates a simple web page that displays the current time and a corresponding image based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, or night). Let's break down the code and understand each part:

### HTML:
* **Basic structure:** Defines the page structure with elements like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Title:** Sets the page title as "Contador de Horas do Dia" (translated as "Hours of the Day Counter").
* **Main section:** Contains a div to display the current time and another div for the image.
* **Footer:** Indicates the code's authorship.

### CSS (style.css):
* Defines the visual style of the page, such as fonts, colors, layout, and element positioning. 

### JavaScript (script.js):
* **mudar() function:**
  * Is executed when the page loads (onload event).
  * Gets the current time using new Date().
  * Extracts the hours and minutes from the date.
  * Updates the content of the HTML elements with the current hours and minutes.
  * Changes the image according to the time of day (basic implementation).
* **setInterval():**
  * Calls the mudar() function every minute to keep the time updated.
