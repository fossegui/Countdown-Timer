Project: Digital Clock with Image
Description:

This simple project creates a web page that displays the current time and a corresponding image based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, or night). The time is updated every minute.

Files:

index.html: The main HTML file for the web page, containing the basic structure.
style.css: CSS file for styling the page and customizing its appearance.
script.js: JavaScript file containing the logic to update the time and change the image.
How it works:

Page Load:
The browser loads the index.html file.
The onload event of the body calls the mudar() function in script.js.
Time Update:
The mudar() function gets the current time from the system.
The HTML elements displaying the time are updated with the obtained values.
Image Change:
The function checks the current time and changes the image to correspond to the time of day (morning, afternoon, or night). This part can be customized to add more images or logic.
Continuous Update:
The setInterval() function calls the mudar() function every minute, ensuring the time is always displayed correctly.
Customization:

Style: Modify the style.css file to customize the appearance of the page.
Images: Add more images to represent different times of day.
Logic: Modify the logic in the mudar() function to add more features, such as:
Displaying the time in 24-hour format.
Adding an analog clock.
Implementing an alarm.
Synchronizing with a precise time server.
Usage:

Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone [https://seu-repositorio.git](https://seu-repositorio.git)
Open the index.html file: Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Notes:

This is a basic project and can be expanded with various features.
The logic for changing the image is simple and can be improved to consider different time zones or lighting conditions.
For greater accuracy, you can use a JavaScript library specialized in handling dates and times.
